      <h1>Hello</h1>
      <p>Hello and welcome, to the <span class="slay">Slayartworx Gallery</span>. My name is Robert Jason Slay; my friends call me Jason.
        I have been creating since the age of five. I have developed my style of
        art over the years by learning from and watching great artists, and following thier progress and careers.
        I am embarking on my journey into hopefully becoming a recognizable name within the art community.
        So what better place to start than my own webpage and gallery, committed to my particular style and perfered genre.
        I want to thank everyone for visiting. Even if you never commision me or buy any of my work, I appreciate you all.</p>

        <h3>Illustrator</h3>
        <p>I have been illustrating most of my life. However, I have been leveraging software apllications only for the past 6 years. Most everything I have learned is through
          online courses as well as trial and error. I utilize 3 software applications the most "sketchbook", "photoshop", and "illustrator".
          One example of my work is the logo header atop this website.</p>
